**Note**: the `start.sh` script will reconfigure Docker in the current shell prompt to use Minikube's Docker daemon as described at https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#reusing-the-docker-daemon

## Runninng it

From project root

# Comments

Maybe wait until I test this from my work machine before trying it yourself!
